Week 1: Angular & DSA Basics + Git Fundamentals

Angular → Components, Modules, Templates, Data Binding

DSA → Arrays, Strings (reverse, rotation, prefix sums, palindrome)

Git → init, add, commit, status, log

SOLID Day 1: Single Responsibility Principle

Pattern Day 2–7: Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Prototype

Week 2: Angular Directives & Services + DSA Hashing/Two Pointers + Git Branching

Angular → Directives, Services, Dependency Injection

DSA → HashMap, Set, Two pointers, Sliding Window

Git → Branching, merging, stash, rebase

SOLID: Open/Closed Principle

Patterns: Adapter, Builder, Command, Facade, Proxy, Template Method

Week 3: Angular Lifecycle & Routing + Linked List + GitHub Basics

Angular → Lifecycle hooks, Routing, Lazy Loading

DSA → Linked List (reverse, detect cycle, merge two lists)

GitHub → Repo creation, fork, clone, pull request workflow

SOLID: Liskov Substitution Principle

Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Composite, Flyweight, Bridge, Iterator, Mediator

Week 4: Angular Forms + Stack/Queue + GitHub Advanced

Angular → Template-driven & Reactive Forms, Validators

DSA → Stack (valid parentheses, min stack), Queue (circular, deque)

GitHub → Issues, Discussions, Tags, Releases, GitHub Actions

SOLID: Interface Segregation Principle

Patterns: State, Memento, Visitor, Interpreter, Abstract Factory, Proxy (review)

Week 5: Angular RxJS Basics + Trees

Angular → Observables vs Promises, Operators (map, filter, switchMap)

DSA → Binary Trees (traversals, height, LCA)

SOLID: Dependency Inversion Principle

Patterns: Observer (deep dive with RxJS), Strategy, Factory Method (applied in Angular services)

Week 6: Angular RxJS Advanced + Binary Search

Angular → Subjects, BehaviorSubjects, AsyncPipe

DSA → Binary Search & problems (rotated array, first/last occurrence)

Patterns: Command, Template Method (applied in Angular forms & services)

Week 7: Angular Change Detection + Recursion & Backtracking

Angular → Change Detection (Default vs OnPush)

DSA → Recursion (fibonacci, factorial), Backtracking (subsets, permutations, N-Queens basics)

Patterns: Decorator (applied in Angular interceptors)

Week 8: Angular Performance Optimization + Trees/Graphs

Angular → TrackBy, Lazy loading, Optimizations

DSA → Graph BFS & DFS (only basics)

Patterns: Observer + Mediator (applied in Angular components communication)

Week 9: Angular State Management + Dynamic Programming (Basics)

Angular → Service-based state mgmt, NgRx (overview)

DSA → DP basics (Fibonacci, climbing stairs, knapsack overview)

Patterns: State Pattern (applied in NgRx-like state management)

Week 10: Angular Testing + Review DSA Core

Angular → Jasmine & Karma (unit testing basics)

DSA → Review arrays, strings, hashing, linked list, stack, trees

Patterns: Factory & Strategy in testing

Week 11: Mock Interviews (DSA + Angular)

Practice Angular interview questions (RxJS, DI, Lifecycle, Optimization)

Solve DSA patterns (sliding window, trees, linked list, binary search)

Week 12: Capstone Project

👉 Build Angular DSA Visualizer App

Implement DSA logic in TypeScript services

Use Angular components to visualize stack, queue, tree, sorting animations

GitHub → host repo with CI/CD

Apply SOLID + Patterns in codebase

⚡ Outcome

After 12 weeks you’ll have:

Strong Angular fundamentals (interview-ready)

Solid DSA problem-solving ability in TypeScript

Confidence in Git & GitHub workflows (team-ready)

Knowledge of SOLID principles & design patterns (senior-level edge)

A portfolio project (DSA Visualizer in Angular) to show recruiters
